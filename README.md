Kapit-Mueller_Model-> By modifying the hopping term in the Hofstadter Hamiltonian, Kapit and Mueller found an lattice model whose ground-state single particle wavefunctions are lowest Landau level wavefunctions. By adding local repulsive interactions, one can achieve Laughlin wavefunction as many-body ground state, therefore achieving the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in the lattice.
